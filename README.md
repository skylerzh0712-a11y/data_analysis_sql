This project focused on analyzing sales,customer and product data to provide actionable business insights. I used MySQL to extract, clean, and analyze large datasets from product, sales, and customer tables. I performed various analyses, including time trends, cumulative growth, part-to-whole contributions, and customer/product segmentation, to uncover key insights and help optimize business strategies.
